# Abstract
In today’s scenario, where time is of prime importance, decoding a complex invoice and reconciliation can be tedious and time consuming. In addition, in this cumbersome process, missing crucial details and spotting errors in the invoice can be an added overhead. To take care of all these day to day issues Invoice-Simplifier extracts key elements from your invoices, and gives you a simplified and informative summary, while also analysing and categorizing the different products / services that drain your wallet the most. Pie charts and graphs has been included as an added advantage to get a better visual understanding of the expenditures. Our application plans to reduce all the overheads from the users’ perspective and make invoice analysis a seamless experience.

The user particpation can be as simple as just uploading a snapshot of the invoice and hit the submit button. The invoice will be directly sent to our backend python data processing service that will take care of all the complex stuffs. Once done the processed data will be displayed to the user for a final confirmation. That's it, it will be ingested into the database summary reports and charts will pop up on the user dashboard.

# Target Users
Small & medium sized business owners specially in developing countries(e.g. India etc.) where printed invoices are still a regular practice and not the digitized ones.

###### Original Professor Feedback :-
Name entity recognition using OCR from a invoice

Develop a service that takes invoices as input and generates a csv with important name and entities which can be ingested into a database. The end to end flow will show the extracted data which user will acknowledge before it gets ingested into db.

use state of the art OCR and language model to build this. take a couple of invoices as examples ..
